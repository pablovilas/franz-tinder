This is an unofficial recipe for Tinder

## How do I install this Franz Recipe?

1. [Download](https://github.com/pablovilas/franz-tinder/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the plugin file
2. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine (note that this dev directory may not exist yet, and you must create it):
    * Mac: ` ~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
    * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
    * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev`
3. Copy the recently unzipped folder into the plugins directory (inside `dev` folder)
